# Haskell Foundation Technical Working Group

---

The Haskell Foundation Technical Working Group (TWG) is a working group of the Haskell Foundation.

## Purpose

The purpose of the TWG is to assess technical proposals on their merits, and to recommend whether the Haskell Foundation should devote resources to particular projects. The members of the TWG are an experienced group of people with knowledge of the Haskell ecosystem, responsible for the strategic technical direction on behalf of the Haskell Foundation. TWG members should be either individuals responsible for a specific part of the Haskell ecosystem, or contributors and committers to parts of it.


## Responsibilities

TWG Members are tasked with the following responsibilities:

- Communicate with the community regarding the Haskell Foundation Technical Proposal (HFTP) process goings-on
- Attend monthly HFTP meetings, weighing in pros and cons of every HFTP
- Accept, postpone or reject each HFTP
- Report regarding the status of assigned HFTPs when designated a shepherd
- Hold elections as member terms expire

## Delegated powers

None.

The TWG may make decisions regarding accepted technical projects. The Delegated Authority shall arrange budgetary or resource requests as needed, based on the outcome of decisions made by the TWG, with the budget committee and Executive Director of the HF.


## Term

The participation of least one person who is an HF Executive or delegated authority is required. General TWG members serve for 3 years.

## Membership

Delegated Authority:

- David Thrane Christiansen ([@david-christiansen](https://github.com/david-christiansen))

## Membership Rules

- Reporting must be accurate, consistent, and in good faith
- Changes to TWG membership require simple majority approval by the members of the TWG
- 1 Delegated authority and 8 general members shall be required for a functioning TWG
- No one may serve two terms consecutively, except for the CTO/delegated authority.
- Elections *must* be held such that there is no period when the TWG is not at full membership. In case of resignations, elections shall be held as soon as reasonably possible.
- The Delegated Authority may, at their discretion, remove members who do not regularly carry out the responsibilities of working group members.

### Election Procedure



The current membership of the TWG vote on new members. Vacancies on the TWG are advertised using the forum designated by the HF bylaws for formal discussion, with a clear deadline and plenty of notice. Interested candidates will be encouraged to self-nominate. All language for the election publication requires prior approval by the ED or other delegated authority. All additional publication on the part of the TWG for the purpose of socializing the election should link to the formal discussion. Elections should be announced publicly between 60 and 70 days before member terms expire, and submissions should cease to be accepted 14 days before member terms expire, with all membership decisions finalized and publicized 7 days before member terms expire. During this 7-day lame duck period, no votes may be made on proposals.

If not enough candidates apply for the number of seats that are expiring or have been vacated, the ED or other HF-delegated authority may fill these seats as needed using their discretion.

Both discussion about potential members and final vote tallies must be kept confidential by members of the TWG.

### Becoming a member

It is not required to be a part of the TWG in order to work on projects. In fact, it's quite the opposite: in order to find a list of projects on which to volunteer, one need only send a message (e.g. an email, slack DM, etc) to the leaders of individual projects. Likewise, individuals may freely contribute ideas and analysis of technical proposals by taking part in the HF Tech Proposal (HFTP) process commentary. However, the TWG exists as the body empowered to ratify proposals and supervise projects to completion.

In order to become a member, one must apply at election time, and be elected to the TWG. With the exception of the first iteration of the TWG, all members are elected by means of the election process.


## Proposal Voting Procedure

Ranked voting is used, with the following criteria required for each status:

### HFTP Statuses

- Acceptance: 66% majority
- Dormant: Simple majority
- Postponed: Simple majority
- Revision needed: Simple majority
- Rejected: 66% majority

### Membership changes

Membership changes require 66% majority for approval.

## Reporting

TWG members are expected to join monthly HFTP review meetings. If shepherding, project statuses should be reported to the TWG by email every two weeks.


## Documents

All HFTP documents, including proposals, templates, charter, and proposal specification documents, live in https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/.


## TWG Bylaws

Changes to this charter can be made at the discretion of the director of the Haskell Foundation, after consulting with the members. Additionally:

* The TWG may change its method of document storage at will.
* The TWG may make changes to its membership according to the rules set out in the *Membership Rules* section above.
